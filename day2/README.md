## Thoughts

I took a really exhaustive approach. Very verbose. Could definitely be simpler.
Would enums make this more readable? (I suppose this could be used similarly to a map?)

## Possible Alternatives

- Use a map instead of match statements.
- Change logic to check if the play values are in win combinations or losing combinations.
